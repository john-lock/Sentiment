Captain's log, stardate 46682.4. The Enterprise is docked at the
Remmler Array, where it will undergo a routine procedure to eliminate
accumulated baryon particles. In preparation for the sweep, we are
evacuating the ship.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CREWWOMAN [OC]: Attention personnel on decks
fourteen and fifteen. Your transporter
room assignment has been changed. Report to transporter room three. <br>
TROI: Captain. We're still behind schedule on decks seven and eight.
Shall I tell Arkaria Base there'll be a delay? <br>
PICARD: No. Open up the transporters in Cargo bay two and divert
everyone from deck seven to there. That should put it back on track. <br>
TROI: Right. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: All beta shift Engineering personnel are requested to
report to main Engineering prior to disembarking. <br>
CRUSHER: Captain. Arkaria Base does not have the medical storage units
I have requested. I have seven living tissue samples that won't survive
the baryon sweep anymore than you or I would. I've tried to reason with
them, but <br>
PICARD: All right, all right. Have Commander LaForge transport a stasis
unit from the astrophysics lab. You should be able to convert it to
store tissue samples. <br>
CRUSHER: Thank you, Captain. <br>
CREWWOMAN [OC]: All science personnel. Please check in with your
section chief for station-side duty assignments. <br>
RIKER: Captain. (comes out of turbolift) I was just heading for deck
seven. I've put the auto-shutdown sequence on hold until we get back on
schedule. <br>
PICARD: Oh, I think we can resume the sequence. Counsellor Troi is
taking care of the situation on deck seven. <br>
RIKER: Aye, sir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Captain. <br>
PICARD: Bridge. <br>
DATA: It has been quite a day, has it not? <br>
PICARD: Yes, it has. <br>
DATA: However, a change of routine is often invigorating and can be a
welcome diversion after a long assignment. <br>
PICARD: Exactly. <br>
DATA: I understand that Arkaria has some very interesting weather
patterns. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, are you all right? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. I am attempting to fill a silent moment with
non-relevant conversation. <br>
PICARD: Small talk. <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. I have found that humans often use small talk during
awkward moments. Therefore, I have written a new subroutine for that
purpose. How did I do? <br>
PICARD: Perhaps it was a little too non-relevant. But if you really are
interested in small talk, then you should keep your eye on Commander
Hutchinson at the reception this afternoon. He's a master. <br>
DATA: Thank you, sir. I will.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Captain. <br>
WORF: Captain. <br>
(they speak over each other) <br>
WORF: After you, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: No, after you. <br>
WORF: No sir. I believe you spoke first. <br>
PICARD: Gentlemen, gentlemen, we're running out of time. Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: The computer needs your authorisation to disable command
functions during the baryon sweep. <br>
PICARD: Are we ready, Commander La Forge? <br>
LAFORGE: Almost. I've requested two additional field diverters. One for
the computer core and one for the Bridge. They haven't been installed
yet. <br>
PICARD: Additional units? <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. We've logged in five years more warp hours than most
ships do in ten, so our baryon particle levels are high. I'm a little
concerned that when the Remmler Array starts to sweep the ship it'll
have to use a stronger beam than normal in order to get rid of all the
radiation. <br>
PICARD: And that might overload the field diverters protecting our key
systems. How long until the new ones are in place? <br>
LAFORGE: I'd say about twenty minutes. <br>
PICARD: Very well. Computer, disable all command functions in thirty
minutes. Authorisation, Picard gamma six zero seven three. <br>
COMPUTER: Authorisation acknowledged. <br>
WORF: Captain, incoming message. It's the station administrator, Mister
Orton. <br>
PICARD: In my Ready room, Mister Worf. <br>
WORF: Captain. Request permission to be excused from Commander
Hutchinson's reception. <br>
PICARD: Permission granted. I wish I could excuse myself as well. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, permission to be <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge, I cannot excuse my entire senior staff. Mister
Worf beat you to it.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Orton. <br>
ORTON [on monitor]: (not a human) Captain, if you're on schedule, I'd
like to confirm that we'll begin the baryon sweep at fifteen hundred
hours, approximately one hour from now. <br>
PICARD: Confirmed. <br>
ORTON [on monitor]: Commander Hutchinson also wanted me to make sure
that you'll be able to attend his reception this afternoon. <br>
PICARD: Tell him I'm looking forward to it. <br>
ORTON [on monitor]: He'll be delighted to hear that. Arkaria Base out.

onto the now deserted Bridge. He takes a long lingering look around
then gets into the turbolift as workers enter from the other side) <br>
KELSEY: (human woman) Tell Arkaria base that we're almost finished
here. <br>
NEIL: (human man) We're going to need two more conduits. <br>
KIROS: (alien woman) I need to run a diagnostic on the diverter. <br>
DEVOR: (dark human man) Get the diverter aligned so that we can begin
the isolation procedure. <br>
NEIL: Where's the ODN interface?
